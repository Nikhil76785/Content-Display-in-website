                Significance of Forests
                The oxygen and temperature levels of the atmosphere are kept stable by forests. Plants produce oxygen during
                photosynthesis while consuming carbon dioxide. This is the entirety of what people do. Forests are a significant source
                of trees and other vegetation. As a result, they contribute by significantly balancing the oxygen content of the entire
                atmosphere.
